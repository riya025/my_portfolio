        <p>
            Hi, I'm Riya Ray 21 years old, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong drive to explore and innovate in the world of technology.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My journey into the world of CSE began when I was first introduced to programming during my early school years. Since then, I've been captivated by the endless possibilities that technology offers. Over the years, I've honed my skills and knowledge through coursework, personal projects, and a hunger for continuous learning.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            I am particularly enthusiastic about the following areas in CSE:
        </p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Software Development: Crafting efficient and user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.</li>
            <li>Data Science: Extracting valuable insights from data and making data-driven decisions.</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Exploring the frontiers of AI to build intelligent systems.</li>
            <li>Web Development: Creating interactive and visually appealing web solutions.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            As I continue my academic journey in CSE, I am excited to combine my technical skills with my passion for innovation to make a positive impact on the world. I believe that technology has the power to reshape industries, enhance human experiences, and drive positive change, and I am committed to being a part of that transformation.
        </p>
